      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The origin of Baguio Colleges Foundation Alumni Association can be traced through its first batch of graduates.</p>
      <p>In 1947, Baguio Colleges was able produce one graduate student and 76 students in the years that had succeeded.At the date of its 71st year in service, UC-BCF was able to produce more than 80, 000 alumni from the elementary, high school, undergraduate, and post-graduate levels.</p>
      <p>In the early days, the BCF Alumni Association was mainly a social group whose interest is centered on the affairs of the college. During the 1980's, active alumni groups have initiated the creation of a university-wide Alumni Association which was eventually named as the UC-BCF Alumni Association. Atty. Erdolfo V. Balajadia was elected President and is still serving the alumni association to this day.</p>
      <p>The fast-growing number of alumni also made the university decide to establish an Alumni Office. The primary function of the Alumni Office is to act as liaison between the university and its alumni. The office also facilitates the giving of timely information regarding university updates, events, programs and community projects that the alumni can be part of.</p>
